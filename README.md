## Innovation Box One: Future Restaurant
### Introduction:
This is a restaurant without waiters or waitress, nor providing any food. It is rather a virtual playground with VR devices that Children can play and have a lot of fun. Although it dose not provide any food, it does serve extremely nutritious drinks by Robots so the children wont get disturbed.

### The Robot
The robot follows tha desigated road that is confined with two black lines. The core of the robot is a Raspberry Pi computer with a USB camera. The software will process the image taken by the camera then determine go straight, left or right. This sounds, but we failed millon times achieving the goal. The solutions that failed are,
1) One Camera follow one line
The issue is that the motors speed cannot be accurately controlled, when the robot turns, the angel it turns is too wide so the line will be out of view very quickly.
